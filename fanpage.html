            Originally formed as a group, Zion I released the debut studio album, Mind over Matter, in 2000.
            It was nominated for "Independent Album of the Year" by The Source <a href="https://www.popmatters.com/zion1-true-2496121232.html">LINK</a>
        
            Since the release of the debut album, Mind Over Matter in 2000, Zion I has risen up the ranks of independent hip-hop to solidify their standing as one of the most prolific conscious rap groups of the past 2 decades. Boasting a catalog that consists of over two-dozen albums, EPs, mixtapes and  collaborations, Zion I (currently consisting solely of MC/producer Zumbi) continues to create inspired music influenced by social & political woes, personal challenges & triumphs as well as family, spirituality and a raw perspective on the world at large.

            Cited by A.V. Club as “remarkable”, Zumbi continues to showcase his talents as a unique, diverse and skilled MC while maintaining his place as one of the most recognizable voices in Hip-Hop. The 2016 release, The Labyrinth was cited by PopMatters as “a timely new album of politically engaged hip-hop”. Fueled by his own personal losses as well as the current political and social climate of the world-at-large, Zumbi has created a record that, as the Huffington Post put it; “is as heartfelt as it is badass”.
            
            Being one of the most energetic and engaging live acts out there, Zion I continues to bring the music to the masses at festivals, events and venues across the planet. With a sound and style that bends musical genres, Zion I is able to perform alongside a diverse range of artists ranging from rap, rock and reggae to jam band and EDM.
            
            With the latest release of Ritual Mystik, Zion I continues to make music that while left-of-center is still relevant, fresh and exciting as ever. As Okayplayer put it; “At the end of the day, Zion I’s strength lies in the same areas where many artists falter – evolving without abandoning tried and tested methods.”

  <p>During the summer, one of the most popular park activities is floating down the Ichetucknee River in an innertube. From the end of May until early September, "tubing" down the river is the premier activity in the park. As the water in this spring-fed river is remarkably clear, swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving are extremely popular</P>
